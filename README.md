Materials produced while I study data engineering.

Data engineering is the process in which raw data are collected from source systems, stored, transformed and then serviced with the highest possible quality to data analysts, data scientists and ML engineers. Therefore, data engineering provides the foundation for effective and efficient data analytics and machine learning. In short, data engineers are the intermediary between data producers and data consumers.
